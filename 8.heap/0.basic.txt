identification
1. something related to size ex. k.
2. smallest/largest.
3. k smallest/kth smallest=max heap of size k.
4. k largest/kth largest=min heap of size k.
5. in max heap, max element is at the top, at the end of the traversal.
6. in min heap, min element is at the top, at the end of the traversal.
7.we make a stack of size equal to k, and when this size becomes greater than k we remove the top element. This is done till we reach the end of the array.
8. for max heap, this stack is known as priority queue.It is under queue header file. Its syntax is:-
priority_queue<int>maxHeap;
9. for min heap, we also use priority_queue. Its syntax is:-
priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>>minHeap;
in this case if we need a pair, we replace int with pair<int,int> or can define this at the top in our code using type def.
ex: type def pair<int,int> p;
//pair<int,pair<int,int>>
10.in cases where k is not given or there is no direct connection of k with smaller/greater/closest,in that case if we require smaller value then we will use minHeap or greater value then we will use maxHeap.
